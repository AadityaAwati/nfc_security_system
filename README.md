# nfc_security_system
A Basic NFC Access Control + Logging System that I made just as a project for my Science Exhibition in my school ...

It combines OpenCV Image Capture, Flask Website Hosting, PySerial Communication, Tkinter GUI, and pyttsx3 Text-To-Speech all into one project.
It is designed to run on the Raspberry Pi 0W, which has only 512 MB RAM, and this is also the reason why the code is very basic. I had a V2 with even being able to access the specific logs of a specific date but that unfortunately slowed the Pi down and lagged too much. I also eventually lost the V2 file.

And Yeah, thats about it ...
